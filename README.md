### A little bit about me... 🧐


<p> I am Industrial Engineer with a great international background who has discovered his passion for programming. Therefore I started studying Computer Engineering through the UNED (currently finishing the last year) and I liked it so much that I decided to do a Bootcamp through Ironhack to be able to develop Web applications at a professional level.

<p>If you are looking for a crazy programmer enthusiast, that's me! 🤓 </p>
